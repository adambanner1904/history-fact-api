<h1><center> History Searcher </center></h1>
        <p> This is a search tool for events throughout history. In the search bar below you can
            search through history in one of four ways.
        </p>

        <ul>
                <li>Text: you can input a string of text that will be searched for
                example like 'roman empire'.</li>
                <li>Year: you can input a four digit number as a year, for BC you can input
                negative numbers for example 79BC is -79.</li>
                <li>Month: you can input the month that you would like to search, this should
                be done as an integer from 1 to 12 representing the months.</li>
                <li>Day: you can input the day of the month as well.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> It should be noted that you do have to input something into at least one of the searches,
        it will not work without something to search.</p>
